# A Guide to Ordinations in Python
For my Data Science Insight Fellowship, I delivered a workshop on using ordinations in Python. We use Ordinations when we would like to either:
1. Look for patterns in the data
2. Constrain/guide a pattern in the data. 

In the **notebooks folder**, you will see a Jupyter Notebook with the content we covered. The **figures** in the notebook folder called figures are also embedded in the main notebook.
